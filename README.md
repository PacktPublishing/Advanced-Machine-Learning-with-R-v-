# Advanced Machine Learning with R [Video]
This is the code repository for [Advanced Machine Learning with R [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/advanced-machine-learning-r-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788291491), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners to develop statistical software and data analysis. Machine Learning is a cross-functional domain that uses concepts from statistics, math, software engineering, and more. 
In this course, you’ll get to know the advanced techniques for Machine Learning with R, such as hyper-parameter turning, deep learning, and putting your models into production through solid, real-world examples. In the first example, you’ll learn all about neural networks through an example of DNA classification data. You’ll explore networks, implement them, and classify them. 
After that, you’ll see how to tune hyper-parameters using a data set of sonar data and you’ll get to know their properties. Next, you’ll understand unsupervised learning with an example of clustering politicians, where you’ll explore new patterns, understand unsupervised learning, and visualize and cluster the data. Moving on, we discuss some of the details of putting a model into a production system so you can use it as a part of a larger application. 

Finally, we’ll offer some suggestions for those who wish to practice the concepts further.
